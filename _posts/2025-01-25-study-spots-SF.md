Over the past few days, I've been diving deep into a fascinating project while exploring different study spots across San Francisco. The project involves fetching information from various media sources and transforming it into vectors for embedding and semantic search to feed into LLMs. I'm also working on a page rank algorithm for ranking users and identifying relevant users within specific Twitter niches.

During this development journey, I've discovered some interesting spots around the city. I started at the SF Main Library across from City Hall, then ventured to Capital One Cafe on another day. But the real gem I discovered was Alamo Square Park.

Getting to Alamo Square Park was an adventure in itself. I grabbed a Bay Wheels bike, and to my surprise (and slight dismay), it wasn't motorized. The uphill pedaling turned into an unexpected endurance test. By the time I reached the park, I was completely out of breath. While bikes aren't technically allowed in the park, I walked it in - not riding, just keeping it by my side.

As I sat down next to my bike, exhausted from the climb, I realized how worthwhile the journey had been. The view was absolutely spectacular - you can see the entire city of San Francisco sprawled out before you. The park's atmosphere was equally captivating. Couples were scattered across the grass, each in their own personal bubble, creating this peaceful, romantic ambiance.

These past few days have been quite the experience. There's something special about balancing development work with exploring San Francisco. The contrast between diving into code and discovering new corners of the city creates a perfect blend of mental and physical engagement. Sometimes the best ideas come when you're not stuck behind a screen, but rather taking in the city's unique energy and views.
