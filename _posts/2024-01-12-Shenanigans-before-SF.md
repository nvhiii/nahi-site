### Last Day in NYC Before SF

What a day. Started off mad early (like 4-5am-ish?). Was half knocked out but caught this hilarious moment - overheard dad trying to feed our cat some noodles. He never really vibes with the cat normally, so overhearing this was sweet and funny.

Eventually dragged myself outta bed, mainly cause I was hyped about this Amazon haul coming through (thank you overnight shipping). After some food, hit up Bloomingdales on 59th. Had two missions: cop this Turkish bath towel and grab YSL MYSLF (btw this cologne? literal liquid gold).

Now here's where the damn trash 4,5,6 trains decided to mess with me. Trying to find the 6 train at 59th was a whole adventure. Who puts a subway station IN the middle of Bloomingdales building?? But wait, it gets better - these 4,5,6 stations are straight up poorly designed. Accidentally hopped on the uptown 6 (didn't realize till I hit 86th street, rip).

Honestly, who designed these stations?? Why can't I just walk through an underpass to get to the downtown side? Instead, gotta exit, cross the street, and drop another $2.90 just to go downtown.

After finally making it to Bleecker, hit up REI for some bag organization stuff for the trip. Side note - REI is literally the Microcenter for hiking/climbing enthusiasts lol. Might have to get into that scene soon, looks pretty fun.

Left REI empty-handed but then scored at GU on Broadway. Copped some of those AIRISM-type tees. They had this sick Neon Genesis Evangelion collection too, but the shirts just didn't fit me right, so rip Final stop was MUJI for some stationery goods, and that wrapped up the shopping for the day.

Got home to the most fire feast from my mom (she always goes all out when I'm heading out). She's literally the best. Spent the rest of the day grinding on this game I'm working on.

Can't even sleep atm cause I'm so hyped for tomorrow! Feel like a kid before vacation, but this is different - it's about creating that environment in SF where we can just focus and grind (with breaks ofc lol).

Stay locked in peeps, till next time.
